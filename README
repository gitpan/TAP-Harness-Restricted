NAME
    TAP::Harness::Restricted - Skip some test files

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        # command line
        $ HARNESS_SUBCLASS=TAP::Harness::Restricted make test

        # bashrc file
        export HARNESS_SUBCLASS=TAP::Harness::Restricted

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a trivial subclass of TAP::Harness. It overrides the
    "aggregate_tests" function to filter out tests that I didn't want
    getting in the way of module installation.

    The current criteria include:

    *   File names that look like pod.t or pod-coverage.t, with optional
        leading numbers

    *   Files that contain the text "use Test::Pod"

    Suggestions for other annoying things to filter out are welcome.

    If someone is inclined to make this extensible so people can put their
    own criteria into configuration files, please email the author with
    ideas before sending a patch.
